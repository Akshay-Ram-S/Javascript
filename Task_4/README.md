## Concepts Learned

**Fetch API** - The Fetch API is a built-in JavaScript interface that allows you to make HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to servers — whether to retrieve data, send form submissions, or communicate with APIs.
<br>

When you use the fetch() API to make a request, it returns a Response object — not the actual data we need. Calling json() method is how you read and parse the body of that response as JSON.

**Advanatges of JSON** <br>

1. Cross language compatability
2. Lightweight
3. Easy to parse in Javascript

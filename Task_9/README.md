## Infinite Scrolling Content Loader

## Objective

To create a web page that loads additional content as the user scrolls toward the bottom.

## Concepts Learned

**document.documentElement** : Destructures document's scroll values: <br>
1. *scrollTop* : how far user has scrolled from the top. <br>
2. *scrollHeight* : full height of the page. <br>
3. *clientHeight* : visible height of the window. <br>

`insertAdjacentHTML()` allows us to insert HTML strings into the DOM at specific positions relative to an existing element â€” and it does it without re-parsing the entire DOM tree.

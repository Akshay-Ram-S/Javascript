## Single-Page Application (SPA) with Hash-based Routing

## Objective

To build a basic Single Page Application that navigates between different views without reloading the page.

## Concepts Learned

**Hash-Based Routing** <br>

1. Uses the part of the URL after # to simulate navigation between pages without reloading.

2. `location.hash` is used to get the current route.

3. `window.addEventListener("hashchange", router)` updates the view when the URL hash changes.

4. `window.addEventListener("hashchange", router)` runs the router whenever the URL hash changes.

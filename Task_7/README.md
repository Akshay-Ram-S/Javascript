## Real-time Chat Simulation

## Objective

To develop a chat interface that simulates real-time messaging without a backend.

## Concepts Learned

**Functions used** <br>

1. setTimeout() – Delays execution of a function (used to delay in replying by bot). <br>
2. new Date() – To get the current date and time. <br>

**scrollTop = scrollHeight** <br>
It keeps the chat always "scrolled to the bottom" when new messages are added.
